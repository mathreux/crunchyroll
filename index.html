            Crunchyroll is an American subscription video on-demand over-the-top streaming service that specializes in the distribution, 
            <br> 
            <br>
            production and licensing of Japanese anime and dorama. Founded in 2006 by a group of University of California, Berkeley, 
            <br>
            <br> 
            graduates, Crunchyroll's distribution channel and partnership program delivers content to over 100 million registered users worldwide.

            <br>
            Crunchyroll was a subsidiary of AT&T's Otter Media, and from 2016 to 2018, the company partnered with Funimation, which would eventually 
            <br>
            <br>
            merge into its brand in 2022 after Sony acquired Crunchyroll in 2021. The company is currently owned by Sony through a joint 
            <br>
            <br>
            venture between Sony Pictures and Sony Music Entertainment Japan's Aniplex.
